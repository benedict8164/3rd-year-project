				<h1>About Oriental Mindoro</h1>
<p>	

Oriental Mindoro (Filipino: Silangang Mindoro, Spanish: Mindoro
Oriental) is a province in the Philippines located in the island
of Mindoro under Mimaropa region in Luzon, about 140 kilometres 
(87 mi) southwest of Manila. The province is bordered by the Verde
Island Passage and the rest of Batangas to the north, by Marinduque,
Maestre de Campo (or known as Sibale but official name is Concepcion)
Island, Tablas Strait and the rest of Romblon to the east, by Semirara
and the rest of Caluya Islands, Antique to the south, and by 
Occidental Mindoro to the west. Calapan, the only city in the island,
is the provincial capital.<br>
Oriental Mindoro is touted as the country's emerging eco-tourism destination.
In 2005, the Philippines was found to be the center of marine fish 
biodiversity and the home of the most diverse marine ecosystem in the world,
by American biologists Kent Carpenter and Victor Springer. Most of the endemic
species in the Philippines are found in the Verde Island Passage between Mindoro 
island and the main island of Luzon. The passage houses 2,983 individual species 
of algae, corals, crustaceans, mollusks, fishes, marine reptiles, and marine mammals,
based on a study conducted by Carpenter and Springer in 2005.
UNESCO declared Puerto Galera a biosphere reserve under its Man and
the Biosphere Programme in the 1970s. The Verde Island Passage is at the 
apex of the so-called Coral Triangle – the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia 
which has the distinction of being the "global center of marine biodiversity".

				<p ><h2 align="center">Mangyan sa Oriental Mindoro</h2></p>


				MANGYAN is the generic name for the eight indigenous groups found in Mindoro island Mindoro (Mindoro is the seventh-largest island in the Philippines), each with its own tribal name, language, and customs.

The ethnic groups from north to south of the island are: Iraya, Alangan, Tadyawan, Tawbuid , Buhid, Hanunoo. An additional group on the south coast is labelled Ratagnon. They appear to be intermarried with lowlanders. The group known on the east of Mindoro as Bangon may be a subgroup of Tawbuid, as they speak the ‘western’ dialect of that language.

The total population may be around 100,000, but no official statistics are available because of the difficulties of counting remote and reclusive tribal groups, many of which have no contact with the outside world.

Mangyan are mainly subsistance agriculturalists, planting a variety of sweet potato, upland rice, and taro. They also trap small animals and wild pig. Many who live in close contact with lowland Filipinos sell cash crops such as bananas and ginger.

Their languages are mutually unintelligible, though they share some vocabulary. Tawbuid and Buhid are closely related, and are unusual among Philippine languages in using the /f/ phoneme. Tawbuid is divided into eastern and western dialects. Western Tawbuid may be the only Philippine language to have no glottal phonemes, having neither /h/ or /?/.

Their traditional religious world view is animistic . Around 10% have embraced Christianity, both Roman Catholicism and Evangelical protestantism. New Testaments have been published in six of the languages.

				<p ><h2 align="center">What is tamaraw?</h2></p>

The tamaraw or Mindoro dwarf buffalo (Bubalus mindorensis) is a small hoofed mammal belonging to the family Bovidae. It is endemic to the island of Mindoro in the Philippines, and is the only endemic Philippine bovine. It is believed, however, to have once also thrived on the larger island of Luzon. The tamaraw was originally found all over Mindoro, from sea level up to the mountains (2000 meters above sea level), but because of human habitation, hunting, and logging, it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now an endangered species.
